# Masters Thesis Research Project: A Novel Approach to Improve Question Answering System using GPT-3 🎓🔍

## Overview 📜
This repository showcases my Masters Thesis Research Project where I delved into innovative techniques to enhance Question Answering Systems. The cutting-edge models BERT and OpenAI GPT-3 were employed, and their performance was evaluated using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).

## Objectives 🎯
- Investigate the efficacy of BERT and GPT-3 in the domain of Question Answering.
- Analyze accuracy and loss metrics for both models.
- Compare the performance of BERT and GPT-3 based on SQuAD evaluations.

## Key Features 🛠️
- **Data Preprocessing**: Adapted the SQuAD dataset to suit the model requirements.
- **Model Training**: Trained BERT and GPT-3 using the processed SQuAD dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculated accuracy and loss for performance assessment.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comprehensive comparison of BERT and GPT-3 performance metrics.
